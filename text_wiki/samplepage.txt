=====  General Notes =====
The markup described on this page is for the default ''Text_Wiki'' rules; it is a combination of the [[http://tavi.sourceforge.net|WikkTikkiTavi]] and [[http://develnet.org/|coWiki]] markup styles.

All text is entered as plain text, and will be converted to HTML entities as necessary.  This means that ''<'', ''>'', ''&'', and so on are converted for you (except in special situations where the characters are Wiki markup; Text_Wiki is generally smart enough to know when to convert and when not to).

Just hit "return" twice to make a paragraph break.  If you want to keep the same logical line but have to split it across two physical lines (such as when your editor only shows a certain number of characters per line), end the line with a backslash ''\'' and hit return once.  This will cause the two lines to be joined on display, and the backslash will not show.  (If you end a line with a backslash and a tab or space, it will //not// be joined with the next line, and the backslash will be printed.)

=====  Inline Formatting =====
| ''<nowiki>//emphasis text//</nowiki>'' | **emphasis text** |
| ''<nowiki>**strong text**</nowiki>'' | **strong text** |
| ''<nowiki>//**emphasis and strong**//</nowiki>'' | ****emphasis and strong**** |
| ''<nowiki>{{teletype text}}</nowiki>'' | ''teletype text'' |
| ''<nowiki>@@--- delete text +++ insert text @@</nowiki>'' | <del> delete text </del><ins> insert text </ins> |
| ''<nowiki>@@--- delete only @@</nowiki>'' | <del> delete only </del> |
| ''<nowiki>@@+++ insert only @@</nowiki>'' | <ins> insert only </ins> |

=====  Literal Text =====
If you don't want Text_Wiki to parse some text, enclose it in two backticks (not single-quotes).
<code>


This //text// gets **parsed**.

``This //text// does not get **parsed**.``

</code>
This **text** gets **parsed**.

<nowiki>This //text// does not get **parsed**.</nowiki>
----
=====  Headings =====
You can make various levels of heading by putting equals-signs before and after the text (all on its own line):
<code>


+++  Level 3 Heading

++++ Level 4 Heading

+++++  Level 5 Heading

++++++ Level 6 Heading
</code>
====  Level 3 Heading ====
=== Level 4 Heading ===
==  Level 5 Heading ==
= Level 6 Heading =----
=====  Table of Contents =====
To create a list of every heading, with a link to that heading, put a table of contents tag on its own line.
<code>

[[toc]]
</code>----
=====  Horizontal Rules =====
Use four dashes (''<nowiki>----</nowiki>'') to create a horizontal rule.
----
=====  Lists =====
====  Bullet Lists ====
You can create bullet lists by starting a paragraph with one or more asterisks.
<code>

* Bullet one
 * Sub-bullet
</code>
  * Bullet one
    * Sub-bullet
====  Numbered Lists ====
Similarly, you can create numbered lists by starting a paragraph with one or more hashes.
<code>

# Numero uno
# Number two
 # Sub-item
</code>
  - Numero uno
  - Number two
    - Sub-item
====  Mixing Bullet and Number List Items ====
You can mix and match bullet and number lists:
<code>

# Number one
 * Bullet
 * Bullet
# Number two
 * Bullet
 * Bullet
  * Sub-bullet
   # Sub-sub-number
   # Sub-sub-number
# Number three
 * Bullet
 * Bullet
</code>
  - Number one
    * Bullet
    * Bullet
  - Number two
    * Bullet
    * Bullet
      * Sub-bullet
        - Sub-sub-number
        - Sub-sub-number
  - Number three
    * Bullet
    * Bullet
====  Definition Lists ====
You can create a definition (description) list with the following syntax:
<code>

: Item 1 : Something
: Item 2 : Something else
</code>Item 1SomethingItem 2Something else----
=====  Block Quotes =====
You can mark a blockquote by starting a line with one or more '>' characters, followed by a space and the text to be quoted.
<code>

This is normal text here.

> Indent me! The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. \ 
Now this the time for all good men to come to the aid of \ 
their country. Notice how we can continue the block-quote \ 
in the same "paragraph" by using a backslash at the end of \ 
the line.
>
> Another block, leading to...
>> Second level of indenting.  This second is indented even \ 
more than the previous one.

Back to normal text.
</code>

Second level of indenting.  This second is indented even more than the previous one.
Back to normal text.

=====  Links and Images =====
====  Wiki Links ====
[[SmashWordsTogether]] to create a page link.

You can force a [[WikiPage]] name **not** to be clickable by putting an exclamation mark in front of it.
<code>

WikiPage !WikiPage
</code>
[[WikiPage]] WikiPage

You can create a "described" or "labeled" link to a wiki page by putting the page name in brackets, followed by some text.
<code>

[WikiPage Descriptive text for the link.]
</code>
[[WikiPage|Descriptive text for the link.]]
**Note:** existing wiki pages must be in the [[RuleWikilink|wikilink]] ''pages'' configuration,  and the [[RuleWikilink|wikilink]] ''view_url'' configuration value must be set for the linking to work.
====  Interwiki Links ====
Interwiki links are links to pages on other Wiki sites. Type the ''<nowiki>SiteName:PageName</nowiki>'' like this:

  * [[MeatBall>RecentChanges|MeatBall:RecentChanges]]
  * [[Advogato>proj/WikkiTikkiTavi|Advogato:proj/WikkiTikkiTavi]]
  * [[Wiki>WorseIsBetter|Wiki:WorseIsBetter]]**Note:** the interwiki site must be in the [[RuleInterwiki|interwiki]] ''sites'' configuration array.
====  URLs ====
Create a remote link simply by typing its URL: [[http://ciaweb.net|http://ciaweb.net]].

If you like, enclose it in brackets to create a numbered reference and avoid cluttering the page; ''<nowiki>[http://ciaweb.net/free/]</nowiki>'' becomes [[http://ciaweb.net/free/|1]].

Or you can have a described-reference instead of a numbered reference:
<code>

[http://pear.php.net PEAR]
</code>
[[http://pear.php.net|PEAR]]

====  Images ====
You can put a picture in a page by typing the URL to the picture (it must end in gif, jpg, or png).
<code>

http://c2.com/sig/wiki.gif
</code>

[[http://c2.com/sig/wiki.gif|http://c2.com/sig/wiki.gif]]

You can use the described-reference URL markup to give the image an ALT tag:
<code>

[http://phpsavant.com/etc/fester.jpg Fester]
</code>

[[http://phpsavant.com/etc/fester.jpg|Fester]]
----
=====  Code Blocks =====
Create code blocks by using ''<code>...</code>'' tags (each on its own line).
<code>

This is an example code block!
</code>
To create PHP blocks that get automatically colorized when you use PHP tags, simply surround the code with ''<code type="php">...</code>'' tags (the tags themselves should each be on their own lines, and no need for the ''<?php ... ?>'' tags).
<code>

 <code type="php">
 // Set up the wiki options
 $options = array();
 $options['view_url'] = "index.php?page=";

 // load the text for the requested page
 $text = implode('', file($page . '.wiki.txt'));

 // create a Wiki objext with the loaded options
 $wiki = new Text_Wiki($options);

 // transform the wiki text.
 echo $wiki->transform($text);
 </code>
</code><code php>

// Set up the wiki options
$options = array();
$options['view_url'] = "index.php?page=";

// load the text for the requested page
$text = implode('', file($page . '.wiki.txt'));

// create a Wiki objext with the loaded options
$wiki = new Text_Wiki($options);

// transform the wiki text.
echo $wiki->transform($text);
</code>----
=====  Tables =====
You can create tables using pairs of vertical bars:
<code>

|| cell one || cell two ||
|||| big ol' line ||
|| cell four || cell five ||
|| cell six || here's a very long cell ||
</code>
| cell one | cell two |
| big ol' line ||
| cell four | cell five |
| cell six | here's a very long cell |
<code>

|| lines must start and end || with double vertical bars || nothing ||
|| cells are separated by || double vertical bars || nothing ||
|||| you can span multiple columns by || starting each cell ||
|| with extra cell |||| separators ||
|||||| but perhaps an example is the easiest way to see ||
