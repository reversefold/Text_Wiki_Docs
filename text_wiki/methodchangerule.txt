''void **changeRule** (string **old rule name** , string **new rule name**)''

This method allows you to change one rule to another in the same place in the rule set.

For example, say you have three rules in your rule set ...

  * rule1
  * rule2
  * rule3
... and you no longer want to use rule2; instead, you want rule4 to go there instead:
<code php>

$wiki->changeRule('rule2', 'rule4');
</code>
Now your rule set looks like this:

  * rule1
  * rule4 <-- changed from rule2
  * rule3
