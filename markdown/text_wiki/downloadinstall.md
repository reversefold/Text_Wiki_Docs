You can see the most recent Text_Wiki package release at [PEAR](http://pear.php.net/)...
[http://pear.php.net/package/Text_Wiki](http://pear.php.net/package/Text_Wiki)
...and install it with the PEAR command-line installer:

	
	
	bash-2.05$ pear install Text_Wiki-{state}

While Text_Wiki is in development, you will need to add the package state to the installation or upgrade command; for example:

	
	
	bash-2.05$ pear upgrade Text_Wiki-alpha
