None.

=====  Description =====
This rule will run a PHP script of your choosing, capture the output of that script, and place it in the source text.  That output will then be subject to parsing by the remaining Text_Wiki rules and rendered appropriately.

All your ''include''-able scripts need to be in the same base directory path (although you can further organize that directory into subdirectories).  You can set that base path with the ''[[MethodSetParseConf|setParseConf()]]'' method:
<code php>

// [snip] create a Text_Wiki object ($wiki)
$wiki->setParseConf('include', 'base', '/path/to/scripts/');
