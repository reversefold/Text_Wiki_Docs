None.

=====  Description =====
This rule will run a PHP script of your choosing, capture the output of that script, and render that output as it is.  The output is not subject to parsing by Text_Wiki rules.  This means the output may or interfere with the output format you choose at render-time if the output is not already in the proper format.

All your ''embed''-able scripts need to be in the same base directory path (although you can further organize that directory into subdirectories).  You can set that base path with the ''[[MethodSetParseConf|setParseConf()]]'' method:
<code php>

// [snip] create a Text_Wiki object ($wiki)
$wiki->setParseConf('embed', 'base', '/path/to/scripts/');
